/**
 * verify-portals.mjs — ATS slug validator for portals.yml.
 *
 * When an entry is added to portals.yml, its ATS slug (the path segment in
 * `careers_url`, e.g. `jobs.lever.co/<slug>`) is easy to guess wrong — and a
 * wrong slug 404s silently on every future scan, so the entry never appears in
 * results and the mistake is invisible. This script probes each entry and
 * reports which resolve, in two tiers (see verifyCompanies() below):
 *   1. Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever — the URL carries a parseable slug, hit
 *      directly; `--add` also cross-probes candidate slugs derived from a name.
 *   2. Every other host (Workday, SmartRecruiters, the aggregator feeds …) —
 *      routed through the same provider plugins the scanner uses.
 *
 * A 200 that returns an empty job list is reported as 'live but empty' — a
 * legitimate state during between-hires periods — kept distinct from an
 * unresolved (404/wrong) slug so a quiet board isn't mistaken for a typo.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node verify-portals.mjs                 # sweep tracked_companies + job_boards in portals.yml
 *   node verify-portals.mjs --add cursor    # probe slug variants for one name
 *   node verify-portals.mjs --strict        # exit non-zero if any slug is unresolved
 *   node verify-portals.mjs --file <path>   # use a specific portals file
 *
 * Network: only the sweep / --add paths hit the network. Importing the module
 * (for tests) runs nothing — main() is guarded — and all network access goes
 * through an injectable `fetchJson`, so the pure logic is testable offline.

/**
 * Derive candidate ATS slugs from a company name.
 *
 * Slugs are conventionally the company name lowercased with separators dropped
 * or dashed, so we generate the common shapes plus the first word alone (many
 * boards use just the brand, e.g. 'Acme Corp' → 'acme'). Order is deterministic
 * and duplicates are removed so `--add` probes each distinct candidate once.
 *
 * SUFFIXES ON THE FIRST WORD ARE PROBE-ONLY (#2937). Every other candidate here
 * either reformats the whole name ('nimbus-data'), abbreviates it without
 * adding anything ('nimbus'), or extends it ('nimbusdataai'). Building a suffix
 * on the FIRST WORD is the one rule that both drops part of the name AND
 * substitutes a token for what it dropped, so what comes out is not a form of
 * this company's name, it is a different company's: 'Nimbus Data' yields
 * 'nimbusai', 'nimbustech', 'nimbuslabs'. The rule has no legitimate yield to
 * lose either. When the name already ends in a suffix word ('Scale AI'), it
 * just reproduces words.join('') and is deduped away, so every candidate it
 * contributes uniquely belongs to somebody else.
 *
 * Offering those to `--add` is fine: an operator reads the slug beside the
 * company name and picks one, and a wrong guess costs a 404. Offering them to
 * discoverAlternates is not. That result is attached as `suggested`, and
 * `fix-slugs --fix` writes it into portals.yml with no further identity check,
 * after which scan.mjs labels the other employer's postings with this
 * company's name. Pass `firstWordSuffixes: false` on any path that writes.
 *
 * The bare first word stays on both paths deliberately: many boards really are
 * just the brand ('Acme Corp' → 'acme'), and it adds no token that the company
 * does not have. It is a narrower risk than this change addresses, not a
 * blessed one.
 *
 * @param {string} name - Company display name.
