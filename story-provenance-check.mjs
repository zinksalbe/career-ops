/**
 * story-provenance-check.mjs — Zero-LLM story-bank provenance checker.
 *
 * Companion to jd-skill-gap.mjs (read that file first — this one deliberately
 * follows its shape: regex-based extraction, no LLM call, classify-and-report
 * only, never auto-edits the user's data files). Where jd-skill-gap.mjs
 * classifies JD *skills* against cv.md in three buckets (existing /
 * supportedByResume / gap), this script classifies *numeric claims found in
 * interview-prep/story-bank.md* against cv.md in FOUR buckets — the extra
 * state is the whole point of this checker (see "Why four buckets" below).
 *
 * ── Background (issue #2947) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `cv.md` is user-authored. `story-bank.md` is *accumulated* — commonly
 * extracted from past interview-prep documents, which are themselves
 * AI-written mappings of the user's experience onto a specific job posting's
 * language. AGENTS.md used to say story-bank.md carries "the same trust
 * level as cv.md". It doesn't, in practice: nothing enforced that a
 * story-bank claim traces back to a user-authored file. That is the
 * unguarded channel this script exists to catch:
 *
 *   JD-shaped phrasing in a prep doc -> absorbed into story-bank.md as a
 *   standalone story -> treated as cv.md-equivalent fact -> surfaces in CV
 *   bullets, cover letters, and interview talk tracks -> drifts further on
 *   reuse.
 *
 * See AGENTS.md's "Source-of-Truth Boundary" section for the tiered file
 * list this script's classification exists to enforce.
 *
 * ── Why four buckets, not jd-skill-gap.mjs's three ────────────────────
 *
 * jd-skill-gap.mjs only ever asks "does cv.md have a trace of this or not" —
 * a binary trace/no-trace question is enough there because nothing is ever
 * auto-added to cv.md either way. This problem needs a state jd-skill-gap.mjs
 * has no equivalent for: not "no trace found (yet)" but "asked, and the user
 * genuinely could not confirm it". A binary verified/unverified flag can't
 * represent that — a scale figure from a job years ago may simply be
 * unknowable, and treating "I don't know" the same as "not yet checked"
 * invites a future re-scan (or a leading confirmation prompt) to silently
 * launder a guess into a "verified" fact. `user-cannot-confirm` is a durable
 * third state, distinct from `derived-unverified`, that must never decay
 * back into either "verified" or "not yet checked" through repetition.
 *
 *   existing            — the claim's number (or, for a range, both its
 *                          endpoints) appears in cv.md, OR the story-bank
 *                          entry's own Provenance field explicitly reads
 *                          `user-stated YYYY-MM-DD` (the user has already
 *                          confirmed this figure even though cv.md's prose
 *                          doesn't carry that precision — AGENTS.md's tiering
 *                          language allows a claim to satisfy this bar by
 *                          tracing to a primary file OR carrying an explicit
 *                          provenance marker, not only the former).
 *   supportedByResume    — the number itself isn't in cv.md, but cv.md's
 *                          prose describes the same underlying fact/role
 *                          closely enough (word-overlap heuristic) that the
 *                          claim reads as plausible-adjacent, just unverified
 *                          at this precision.
 *   derived-unverified    — the number appears ONLY in story-bank.md, has no
 *                          traceable cv.md support, and has not been
 *                          explicitly confirmed via the Provenance field.
 *   user-cannot-confirm    — the story-bank entry's Provenance field is
 *                          explicitly set to `user-cannot-confirm`. This is a
 *                          HARD override: it wins over whatever the numeric
 *                          heuristic would otherwise conclude, and it is
 *                          never silently reclassified back to
 *                          derived-unverified (or up to existing) on a later
 *                          run just because the same claim gets cited again.
 *                          See "Confirmation UX invariant" below.
 *
 * ── Provenance field convention (story-bank.md) ───────────────────────
 *
 * match-star.mjs's parser already reads story-bank.md as `### [Theme] Title`
 * blocks of `**Label:** value` lines (Situation / Task / Action / Result /
 * Reflection / Source / Best for questions about). A `**Source:**` field
 * already exists there for a different purpose (where the story itself came
 * from — e.g. a debrief transcript). This script introduces a SEPARATE label
 * for the same block shape, so it composes with the existing parser
 * convention instead of overloading a field that already means something
 * else:
 *
 *   **Provenance:** source: cv.md
 *   **Provenance:** user-stated 2026-08-10
 *   **Provenance:** derived-unverified
 *   **Provenance:** user-cannot-confirm
 *
 * Absent field == `derived-unverified` (the safe default: unmarked numeric
 * claims get no special trust). This script only READS the field — writing
 * it back is the explicit responsibility of a future confirmation workflow
 * (see next section), never this one.
 *
 * ── Confirmation UX invariant (DESIGN REQUIREMENT — read before building
 *    the consuming workflow) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This script is read-only: it reports `derived-unverified` findings, it
 * does not resolve them. Building the interactive confirmation flow that
 * asks the user and writes the Provenance marker back to story-bank.md is
 * explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this script (issue #2947) — but the contract
 * that flow MUST honor is documented here so a future implementer can't get
 * it wrong:
 *
 *   1. When a `derived-unverified` finding is surfaced to the user, the
 *      prompt must NOT lead with the unverified number as if confirm/deny
 *      were the only options. Leading with the number invites a guess, and a
 *      confirmed guess is worse than an honest unknown — it launders the
 *      guess into a "verified" fact.
 *   2. Present the claim plainly and offer FOUR distinct, unbiased outcomes:
 *        (a) confirm the claim is accurate as stated
 *        (b) provide the correct figure
 *        (c) mark it narrative-only / not a quantified claim
 *        (d) "I don't know" -> sets `user-cannot-confirm`, durably
 *   3. `user-cannot-confirm` must NEVER decay back into being treated as
 *      verified through repeated citation or a later re-scan. Every
 *      consumer of story-bank.md (CV generation, cover letters, interview
 *      prep) must treat a `user-cannot-confirm` entry as narrative texture
 *      only — never as a quantified claim in interview-facing output where a
 *      follow-up question would probe it. This script enforces the
 *      READ-side half of that invariant (the override always wins, see
 *      classifyStoryBank() below); the WRITE-side half (never re-prompting
 *      a `user-cannot-confirm` entry into a guess) belongs to that future
 *      workflow.
 *
 * ── Pattern coverage (what IS and ISN'T scanned) ──────────────────────
 *
 * Deliberately not exhaustive — matches jd-skill-gap.mjs's design stance
 * that under-extraction is recoverable (the user can still read the story)
 * while over-extraction would misreport narrative prose as a "claim". Five
 * patterns, each documented at its declaration below:
 *
 *   percent      \d+(\.\d+)?%                      "cut costs 40%"
 *   plus-noun     \d+\+\s+word                       "500+ employees"
 *   hour-range    N hours/hrs (→|->|to) M hours/hrs   "8 hours to 2 hours"
 *   scale-hyphen  \d+-(person|member)                 "15-person team"
 *   scale-noun    \d+ (students|employees|...)        "50 students"
 *
 * Known gaps (not covered, intentionally, to keep the pattern set legible
 * and low-noise — same tradeoff jd-skill-gap.mjs's SKILL_TOKEN_RE makes):
 *   - spelled-out numbers ("fifty students")
 *   - currency figures ("$40K budget") — verify-cv-facts.mjs already owns
 *     currency/metric-noun extraction for generated documents; this script
 *     stays scoped to story-bank.md's narrative shapes instead of
 *     duplicating that gate
 *   - non-ASCII digit scripts (verify-cv-facts.mjs's foldDigits() solves
 *     this for generated CVs; story-bank.md is authored in the profile's
 *     language, so this is a smaller gap here, but still a gap)
 *   - a bare number with no adjacent noun/unit ("trained 40 in Q1")
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node story-provenance-check.mjs
 *   node story-provenance-check.mjs --summary
 *   node story-provenance-check.mjs --story-bank path/to/file.md --cv path/to/cv.md

 * The strip keeps letters, combining marks and digits of ANY script. It used
 * to be `[^a-z0-9\s]`, which deletes every non-ASCII letter, and that broke
 * this checker in both directions on a CV that is not written in ASCII:
 *
 *   - Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, CJK — every character is stripped, the
 *     window yields NO words at all, and an empty list makes both
 *     hasScopedNumberMatch (`claimWords.includes`) and hasContextOverlap
 *     (`words.some`) unconditionally false. So `existing` and
 *     `supportedByResume` are unreachable and every claim the patterns do
 *     extract lands in `derived-unverified` — including a figure sitting
 *     verbatim in cv.md with matching context.
 *   - Accented Latin — the strip does not just delete, it re-cuts the word:
 *     "évaluation" becomes " valuation", a DIFFERENT real English word that
 *     can then overlap cv.md prose that has nothing to do with the claim.
 *     Shorter words vanish outright ("Größe", "naïve", "señor" all fall under
 *     the length floor once split).
 *
 * That matters more here than in a grouping key. `derived-unverified` is what
 * AGENTS.md's "Confirmation UX invariant" hands to the user to confirm or
 * deny, and its stated risk is that a confirmed guess launders a guess into a
 * verified fact. A checker that reports 100% unverified for a non-ASCII CV
 * hands over a list where every entry is noise, which is how a user learns to
 * confirm without reading.

### [Automation] Onboarding Workflow
**Situation:** New hires spent too long configuring onboarding tools manually.
**Task:** Cut ramp time without losing quality.
**Action:** Built an automated workflow using a custom LMS integration.
**Result:** Ramp time dropped from 8 hours to 2 hours per cohort.
**Best for questions about:** automation, process improvement

### [Leadership] LMS Migration Team
**Situation:** The LMS migration needed dedicated team leadership.
**Task:** Keep the migration on schedule with no data loss.
**Action:** Led a 15-person team through the full migration.
**Result:** Migration completed on time with zero data loss.
**Best for questions about:** leadership, project management

### [Scale] Statewide Rollout
**Situation:** Leadership wanted a large-scale training rollout.
**Task:** Reach as many staff as possible within one quarter.
**Action:** Built self-paced modules and distributed them broadly.
**Result:** 500+ employees completed the rollout within the quarter.
**Best for questions about:** scale, training design

### [Budget] Vendor Negotiation
**Provenance:** user-cannot-confirm
**Situation:** The training budget needed renegotiation with a vendor.
**Task:** Cut licensing costs without losing seats.
**Action:** Renegotiated the vendor contract.
**Result:** Estimated 40% savings on licensing costs, though the original invoice could not be located to confirm the exact figure.
**Best for questions about:** negotiation, cost savings
