# Mode: pdf — ATS-Optimized PDF Generation

Optional pass:
- **`--hm-audit`:** `/career-ops pdf --hm-audit` adds the hiring-manager audit at Step 20 — an adversarial read of the tailored CV by a separate, research-grounded reviewer before it becomes a PDF (`modes/pdf/hm-audit.md`). Off by default: it costs a subagent dispatch plus web research. Turn it on per run with the flag, or for every run in your own `modes/_custom.md`.

## Full pipeline

## Application-scoped artifacts

When a CV is reused or lightly tailored for an existing application, initialize a bundle with `npm run application:init -- --report {report-number} --company "{company}" --role "{role}" --version 1`. Keep the current JD at `jd/current.md`, the comparison JD at `jd/previous.md`, the source CV at `cv/source/original.html`, the tailored CV at `cv/tailored/v001/cv.html`, the PDF at `cv/tailored/v001/cv.pdf`, the change notes at `cv/tailored/v001/changes.md`, and the reuse decision at `decision/reuse.json` under the printed bundle root. Resolve the application/report first with `node find.mjs {report-or-tracker-number}` so the bundle uses the report number, not an ambiguous tracker row.

Run `npm run jd:similarity -- {bundle-root}/jd/current.md {bundle-root}/jd/previous.md` when both comparison sources exist. Record the visible decision (`reuse`, `reuse-with-edits`, or `regenerate`), score, source CV/JD paths, and changed sections in `decision/reuse.json`. Strongly discourage applications scoring below 4.0/5 and proceed only when the user explicitly overrides that recommendation. Reuse only after a visible `reuse` result or an explicit user override; never silently reuse when a source is missing. The PDF manifest supports these nested paths and continues to link them to the report. Flat `output/` paths remain valid for one-off PDFs.

1. Read `cv.md` as the source of truth
2. Ask the user for the JD if it is not in context (text or URL)
3. Extract 15-20 keywords from the JD
4. Run the zero-LLM skill-gap check before drafting anything: **always** write the JD to `jds/{slug}.md` first — required, not conditional, even when a report for this application already exists — then `node jd-skill-gap.mjs jds/{slug}.md --summary`. This classifies the JD's explicit requirements against `cv.md` into three buckets — never surface `result.gap` items as if the candidate has them:
   - **JD archival (required, #2789):** this write doubles as the JD archive for this application. A `**URL:**` header alone is a live pointer, not an archive — it rots once the posting closes. When this run is part of a full `oferta` evaluation, the report's own `## Job Description (archived verbatim)` section is the primary archive and this `jds/{slug}.md` write is a secondary copy; when `pdf` is run standalone (no report), this file IS the archive, so prefer naming/keying it to the report with `archive-posting.mjs --report={num}` when a report number exists. `check-jd-archive.mjs` validates every report has one form or the other. If a posting date is visible anywhere in the source — URL-scraped page text, pasted JD text, or a screenshot being transcribed — include it as the first line of the file: `Posted: {date or relative string as shown}`, or `Posted: not visible in source` when absent. Never substitute the report file's own filesystem mtime/creation time for this — it records when the candidate processed the JD, not when the employer posted it.
   - `existing` — already a named skill in cv.md's Skills section, safe to lead with
   - `supportedByResume` — not a named skill yet, but cv.md's prose already demonstrates it; legitimate candidates for the Skills section in the user's own words (Step 13's competency grid draws from here first)
   - `gap` — cv.md has no trace of it at all. **Tell the user explicitly which skills are gaps before generating the CV.** Never paper over a gap by inventing a claim, and never silently drop it from the conversation — the user decides whether to proceed, address it in the cover letter/interview, or skip the role

   If the output prints a `🚨 LOW CONFIDENCE` block, zero skills were classified, so the three empty buckets mean "nothing was classified", not "no gaps found". **Never treat this as a pass, whichever reason is given.** Read the JD yourself to identify the required skills before drafting, and tell the user the automated check produced no result. The reason code says which of the three shapes it is:
   - `no-requirements-section` — no requirements section was recognized, so no text was scanned at all
   - `no-skill-candidates` — a requirements section was scanned, but no skill candidates came out of it. This does not mean the skills are absent from the vocabulary; the extractor only picks up capitalized tokens, so a lowercase bullet yields nothing
   - `empty-jd` — the JD file has no content, so there was nothing to read. Check the file was written correctly before continuing

   > ⚠️ **Skill-gap check inconclusive:** [Render in {language.output}: state that the automated skill-gap check returned no classified skills for this JD and so cannot be read as "no gaps"; name which of the three shapes occurred from the reason code (requirements section never found, or found but no candidates extracted, or the JD file was empty); for an empty file, say the JD may not have been saved correctly and should be checked; otherwise say that you will read the JD directly to identify required skills before drafting. Keep the CLI's own English diagnostic out of the user-facing message.]
5. Use `language.output` for the CV language. The JD language and `language.modes_dir` supply market vocabulary and evaluation context, but never override the configured output language.
6. Detect company location → paper format:
   - US/Canada → `letter`
   - Rest of the world → `a4`
7. Detect role archetype → adapt framing
8. Before tailoring, optionally compare the new JD with the latest tailored CV or JD. Resolve the application/report first with `node find.mjs {report-or-tracker-number}`. Use the resolved report/JD snapshot as `{new-jd.txt}` and the referenced prior CV or prior JD as `{previous-jd-or-cv.txt}`; if either source cannot be located, do not silently reuse a CV. Run `npm run jd:similarity -- {new-jd.txt} {previous-jd-or-cv.txt}` and display the `decision` and `score`. Reuse is allowed only when the recommendation is `reuse` or the user explicitly overrides it; `reuse-with-edits` still requires the listed edits, and `regenerate` requires the normal tailoring flow.
9. Build an internal recruiter-side risk map from the JD using `modes/heuristics/recruiter-side.md`: likely doubts, matching evidence, and which document section should address each doubt
10. Rewrite Professional Summary by injecting JD keywords + exit narrative bridge ("Built and sold a business. Now applying systems thinking to [JD domain].")
11. Select top 3-4 most relevant projects for the job. If `cv.md` carries an Awards / Honors section, populate `awards[]` with the entries that support this role — for an early-career candidate a contest medal or dean's list often outranks a thin project. Omit the key when there is nothing to list and the section disappears entirely; never invent an award to fill it
12. Reorder experience bullets by JD relevance and by the risk map: strongest matching evidence first
13. Build competency grid from JD requirements (6-8 keyword phrases), prioritizing `existing` and `supportedByResume` skills from Step 4 — never a `gap` skill
14. Inject keywords naturally into existing achievements (NEVER invent)
15. Apply the six-second clarity gate from `modes/heuristics/recruiter-side.md`: top third must make target role, strongest fit, and proof obvious
16. Read `name` from `config/profile.yml` → normalize to kebab-case lowercase (e.g. "John Doe" → "john-doe") → `{candidate}`
17. Build the render payload (see the **JSON Input Schema** below) from the tailored content — emit compact structured JSON, **not** full HTML markup — and write it to `/tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.json`
18. Run `node build-cv-html.mjs /tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.json {html-path} {template}`, where `{html-path}` is the active bundle's `cv/tailored/vNNN/cv.html` or `output/cv-{candidate}-{company}.html` for a one-off CV, and `{template}` is the path printed by **Selecting the template** below (omit it to use the base template). The script owns every tag, CSS class, and HTML escaping. Keep the HTML outside temporary storage because the dashboard's `D` hotkey regenerates from it.
19. Run the fact gate against the generated HTML: `node verify-cv-facts.mjs {html-path}`
    - This is a hard gate before PDF rendering.
    - If it fails, stop and fix the generated HTML by removing invented metrics or adding verified evidence to `cv.md`, `article-digest.md`, or `config/cv-facts.json`.
20. **Hiring-manager audit — off by default, opt-in only.** Run `modes/pdf/hm-audit.md` if and only if one of these is true; otherwise skip straight to Step 21 without prompting.
    - The invocation carried `--hm-audit` (`/career-ops pdf --hm-audit`, or the same flag on a natural-language request).
    - `modes/_custom.md` turns it on as a house rule.

    The fact gate proves nothing was invented; it cannot tell you whether these are the *right* bullets for the role. The audit researches the likely reviewer, dispatches a separate subagent role-playing them, and returns a bullet-by-bullet keep/cut/rewrite verdict plus a blunt "would I advance this to a screen?" call. It adds a subagent dispatch plus web research on top of the tailoring, which is why it is opted into rather than run on every PDF.

    The audit recommends; the user decides. If they take any rewrite, return to Step 17, rebuild the payload and the HTML, and re-run the fact gate before rendering. The audit is persisted only once that decision is known, and records which rewrites were applied — so the `## HM Audit` section never describes a CV the rendered PDF no longer matches. Do not re-run the audit against the rebuilt CV: a second dispatch doubles the cost for a verdict the user has already acted on.
21. Execute: `node generate-pdf.mjs {html-path} {pdf-path} --format={letter|a4} --report={report number}`, where `{pdf-path}` is the active bundle's `cv/tailored/vNNN/cv.pdf` or `output/cv-{candidate}-{company}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf` for a one-off CV. `{report number}` is the NNN from the report filename/link (e.g. `008` for `reports/008-acme-….md`), not the tracker `#` column. Pass it whenever the application has (or will have) a report; it records the PDF↔report linkage in `data/pdf-index.tsv` so the dashboard can open and regenerate the exact nested or flat HTML/PDF pair. Omit it only for one-off CVs with no tracker entry.
    - The rendered PDF has a two-page warning threshold by default. `--max-pages=N` accepts a positive integer; pass `--max-pages=1` when the user or market prefers a one-page CV.
    - If the rendered PDF exceeds its threshold, generation warns loudly with the actual and allowed page counts plus trimming guidance, then reports and indexes the unchanged PDF so existing longer-CV flows keep working.
    - Pass `--strict-pages` only when the user or market requires a hard limit. Strict overflow leaves the draft available for inspection but does not report or index it as successful; trim lower-priority content and rerun.
22. Report: PDF path, number of pages, keyword coverage %, and any skill gaps from Step 4 still unaddressed

## ATS Rules (clean parsing)

- Single-column layout (no sidebars, no parallel columns)
- Standard headers: "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Certifications", "Projects"
- Optional sections (Core Competencies, Work Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications, Awards & Honors, Skills) are dropped entirely — header included — when their array is empty or absent
- No text in images/SVGs
- No critical info in PDF headers/footers (ATS ignores them)
- UTF-8, selectable text (not rasterized)
- No nested tables
- Distributed JD keywords: Summary (top 5), first bullet of each role, Skills section
- No hidden text, keyword stuffing, or white-font tricks. Optimize for parseability plus human review.

**Optional parseability check:** after generating the HTML you can score it for ATS-friendliness with `node verify-ats.mjs output/cv-{candidate}-{company}.html` (see `modes/ats.md`). This is deterministic, read-only, and advisory — it reports a 0-100 score plus concrete issues but never blocks generation (unlike the `verify-cv-facts.mjs` fact gate in Step 18).

## Recruiter Review Gates

- The summary should answer: "What role is this person targeting, and why this one?"
- The first screen should show 1-2 proof points that map to the JD's highest-risk requirements.
- Bullets should emphasize outcomes, systems, users, or business effects rather than task history.
- Logistics such as location, work authorization, salary, and availability belong in the CV only when appropriate for the market and profile; otherwise handle them in form answers or recruiter scripts.

## PDF Design

- **Fonts**: Space Grotesk (headings, 600-700) + DM Sans (body, 400-500)
- **Fonts self-hosted**: `fonts/`
- **Header**: name in Space Grotesk 24px bold + gradient line `linear-gradient(to right, hsl(187,74%,32%), hsl(270,70%,45%))` 2px + contact row
- **Section headers**: Space Grotesk 13px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em, color cyan primary
- **Body**: DM Sans 11px, line-height 1.5
- **Company names**: accent purple color `hsl(270,70%,45%)`
- **Margins**: 0.6in
- **Background**: pure white

## Section order (optimized "6-second recruiter scan")

1. Header (large name, gradient, contact, portfolio link)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 lines, keyword-dense)
3. Core Competencies (6-8 keyword phrases in flex-grid)
4. Work Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Projects (top 3-4 most relevant)
6. Education & Certifications
7. Skills (languages + technical)

## Keyword injection strategy (ethical, truth-based)

Examples of legitimate reformulation:
- JD says "RAG pipelines" and CV says "LLM workflows with retrieval" → change to "RAG pipeline design and LLM orchestration workflows"
- JD says "MLOps" and CV says "observability, evals, error handling" → change to "MLOps and observability: evals, error handling, cost monitoring"
- JD says "stakeholder management" and CV says "collaborated with team" → change to "stakeholder management across engineering, operations, and business"

**NEVER add skills that the candidate does not have. Only reword real experience using the exact JD vocabulary.**

## Template HTML

**Before generating: read `modes/_custom.md` (if it exists) and apply its formatting/content house rules to every CV in this session — including every item of a batch.** Rules recorded there (date formats, section-order preferences, content to always/never include) are persistent user instructions, not suggestions; if the user corrects the same thing twice in conversation, write it into `modes/_custom.md` so it stops drifting.

### Selecting the template

Resolve which template to fill with the shared resolver (do not hardcode `cv-template.html`):

- If the user named a template this turn (e.g. "use the *modern* template"), run:
  `node cv-templates.mjs resolve cv "<name>"`
- Otherwise run: `node cv-templates.mjs resolve cv`
  (this returns the `cv.template` default from `config/profile.yml`, or the base `cv-template.html` when unset).

The command prints the absolute path of the template to fill; a non-zero exit means the named template is missing or invalid — surface that message to the user instead of silently falling back.

To show the user their options (e.g. "what CV templates do I have?"), run `node cv-templates.mjs list cv` and present each `displayName`.

`build-cv-html.mjs` fills that resolved template from the JSON payload you build — it owns every tag, CSS class, and the HTML escaping, so you **never emit full HTML markup** and do **not** escape `&`/`<`/`>`/quotes yourself. Pass the resolved path as the third argument (`node build-cv-html.mjs <input.json> <output.html> <template.html>`); omit it to fall back to the base `cv-template.html`. This is the HTML twin of `build-cv-latex.mjs` (see `modes/latex.md`) and cuts the PDF step's output tokens from full markup down to the compact payload below (#557).

### JSON Input Schema

Write a JSON file with this structure, then run `node build-cv-html.mjs <input.json> <output.html> [template.html]` (the optional third argument is the template path from **Selecting the template**; omit it for the base `cv-template.html`).

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `lang` | string | CV language code (`en`, `es`, `zh-CN`, `ja`, `ar`). Drives language-specific CSS: `zh-CN` enables Simplified Chinese fonts and strict CJK line breaking; `ja` enables a Japanese CJK font fallback; `ar` enables RTL + Arabic fonts. Defaults to `en`. |
| `page_format` | string | `letter` → `8.5in` page width, `a4` → `210mm`. Defaults to `letter`. Pass the SAME value to `generate-pdf.mjs --format`. |
| `candidate.name` | string | From `profile.yml`. |
| `candidate.phone` | string | Optional — **omit or leave empty** to drop the `tel:` link and its separator (no empty cell). |
| `candidate.email` | string | From `profile.yml`. |
| `candidate.linkedin` | `{url, display}` | Optional — omit to drop the item and its separator. |
| `candidate.github` | `{url, display}` | Optional — omit to drop the item and its separator. |
| `candidate.portfolio` | `{url, display}` | Optional — omit to drop the item and its separator. |
| `candidate.location` | string | From `profile.yml`. |
| `candidate.photo` | string | Opt-in profile photo (#264): a local path or `data:` URL. Empty/absent emits **no `<img>`**, rendering pixel-for-pixel identical to the photoless layout (US/UK/many-market ATS penalize photos; opt in for DACH/European markets). |
| `candidate.photo_style` | string | Optional photo framing: `rounded` (default), `circle`, or `square`. Read it from `candidate.photo_style` in `config/profile.yml`; invalid values fail before HTML is written. |
| `sections` | object | Optional localized section titles; any omitted key falls back to the English default shown above. |
| `summary` | string | Personalized summary with keywords. Supports `**…**` emphasis (see **Markdown bold** below). |
| `competencies` | string[] | 6-8 keyword phrases → competency tags. |
| `experience[]` | object | `company`, `role`, `location` (optional), `dates`, `bullets` (reordered, keyword-injected; `**…**` emphasis supported). Optional section — omit the key or pass `[]` and the whole block is dropped, header included. Only for candidates with no professional history to list (students, new graduates, career changers); never drop it to hide a gap. |
| `projects[]` | object | `name`, `url` (optional project/repo link), `badge` (optional), `tech` (optional), `description` (a `bullets` array is also accepted and joined into the description line). |
| `education[]` | object | `title` (degree), `org` (institution), `location` (optional, city/state), `year`, `description` (optional). |
| `certifications[]` | object | `title`, `org`, `year`. |
| `awards[]` | object | `title` (award name), `org` (issuing body, optional), `year` (optional). Optional section — omit the key or pass `[]` and the whole block is dropped, header included. Use it for competitive or academic distinctions (olympiad medals, hackathon wins, dean's list) that carry more signal than a thin experience section. |
| `skills[]` | object | `items` (**required**): a non-blank comma-separated string, or a non-empty array of non-blank strings — every element must be text, since the builder joins the whole array. `category` (optional): omitted, the line renders without its prefix. |

`build-cv-html.mjs` errors out (non-zero exit) if any template placeholder is left unresolved, so a malformed payload fails loudly instead of shipping a broken CV. Run `node build-cv-html.mjs --test` for a self-test render.

**The key names above are enforced, not suggestions (#3523).** Every list section (`experience`, `projects`, `education`, `certifications`, `awards`, `skills`) is rendered from exactly the keys listed in this table. The payload root must be an object. Before rendering, `build-cv-html.mjs` validates each entry:

- **Missing or blank required field → hard error, non-zero exit, no HTML written.** Required: `company` + `role` for experience, `name` for projects, `title` for education, certifications and awards, `items` for skills (a non-blank string or a non-empty array of them; `category` stays optional).
- **A key no builder reads → warning on stderr and in the report's `warnings[]`;** the build proceeds and the key is ignored.
- **A top-level section name the builder does not read → warning**, naming the nearest known key. A payload with `educations` instead of `education` used to validate clean and drop the section silently; it now says so.

Do **not** substitute the LaTeX builder's vocabulary — `institution`/`degree`/`dates`/`coursework` is the `modes/latex.md` education schema, **not** this one — nor `employer` for a company or `name` for a certification. Such an entry used to render as an empty block while the report still said `"valid": true`, and CVs went out with no education section at all. It is now rejected by name. When in doubt, check `counts.educationEntries` (and its siblings) in the JSON report: a zero there means the section is empty in the PDF.

### Markdown bold

Wrap a span in `**…**` to emphasise it — typically the quantified result a recruiter should catch in the six-second scan:

```json
"bullets": ["Cut p99 latency from 840 ms to **120 ms** across 14 services"]
```

`generate-pdf.mjs` converts it to `<strong>` during ATS normalization (#1728), and the template styles it in both the summary and job bullets. On the HTML path the conversion walks every text node, so **any** field can carry `**…**`.

**The LaTeX twin is narrower — check `modes/latex.md` before reusing a payload across both.** `build-cv-latex.mjs` renders `**…**` as `\textbf{…}` (#3351) only in what it emits inside a `\resumeItem`: `experience[].bullets`, `projects[].bullets`, and the `education[].coursework` line. It has no `summary` field at all, and `projects[].name`, `awards[].title` and the `skills[]` fields print `**` literally. Bullets emphasise the same way in both formats; nothing else is guaranteed to.

**The escaping runs first, and that order is the safety property.** `build-cv-html.mjs` owns the HTML escaping, and only the `**` markers it left untouched are reinterpreted afterwards — a literal `<script>` typed into a bullet stays escaped inside the bold span. Only `**`-delimited spans are affected; single asterisks and unmatched markers stay literal.

**A bold span cannot contain a `*`.** `**tripled *3x* throughput**` matches nothing and ships the asterisks literally — no error, no warning. Rewrite it as `**tripled 3x throughput**` rather than nesting emphasis.

Emphasis is not a substitute for evidence — bold reorders attention, it does not add claims. The no-fabrication rule applies to bolded text exactly as it does to the rest of the bullet, and bolding every other phrase emphasises nothing.

### Profile photo (opt-in, market-specific)

The `{{PHOTO}}` slot is **off by default** and intentionally market-specific:

- **DACH / much of continental Europe** (Germany, Austria, Switzerland): a professional photo is standard and often expected. Opt in by setting `candidate.photo` in `config/profile.yml` (a local file path or a `data:` URL).
- **US / UK / Canada / Australia and many ATS-first markets**: photos are discouraged and can trip bias-avoidance filters. Leave `candidate.photo` empty — the `{{PHOTO}}` line is dropped entirely, no `<img>` is emitted, and the CV renders **pixel-for-pixel identical** to today's photoless layout.

When set, the photo floats into the top corner (mirrored for RTL/Arabic) and the header/summary text wraps beside it; `.cv-photo` in `cv-template.html` controls its size and framing.

Local photo paths may be absolute or relative to the career-ops project root.
The builder validates PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF inputs and inlines them as data
URLs so the saved HTML remains portable. To inspect the result before PDF
generation, run:

```bash
node build-cv-html.mjs --preview /tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.json {template}
```

The preview is written to `output/cv-preview.html`. A missing, unreadable, empty,
or unsupported photo fails with an actionable error before any output is written.

## Canva CV Generation (optional)

If `config/profile.yml` has `cv.canva_resume_design_id` set, offer the user a choice before generating:
- **"HTML/PDF (fast, ATS-optimized)"** — existing flow above
- **"Canva CV (visual, design-preserving)"** — new flow below

If the user has no `cv.canva_resume_design_id`, skip this prompt and use the HTML/PDF flow.

### Canva workflow

#### Step 1 — Duplicate the base design

a. `export-design` the base design (using `cv.canva_resume_design_id`) as PDF → get download URL
b. `import-design-from-url` using that download URL → creates a new editable design (the duplicate)
c. Note the new `design_id` for the duplicate

#### Step 2 — Read the design structure

a. `get-design-content` on the new design → returns all text elements (richtexts) with their content
b. Map text elements to CV sections by content matching:
   - Look for the candidate's name → header section
   - Look for "Summary" or "Professional Summary" → summary section
   - Look for company names from cv.md → experience sections
   - Look for degree/school names → education section
   - Look for skill keywords → skills section
c. If mapping fails, show the user what was found and ask for guidance

#### Step 3 — Generate tailored content

Same content generation as the HTML flow (Steps 1-11 above):
- Rewrite Professional Summary with JD keywords + exit narrative
- Reorder experience bullets by JD relevance
- Select top competencies from JD requirements
- Inject keywords naturally (NEVER invent)

**IMPORTANT — Character budget rule:** Each replacement text MUST be approximately the same length as the original text it replaces (within ±15% character count). If tailored content is longer, condense it. The Canva design has fixed-size text boxes — longer text causes overlapping with adjacent elements. Count the characters in each original element from Step 2 and enforce this budget when generating replacements.

#### Step 4 — Apply edits

a. `start-editing-transaction` on the duplicate design
b. `perform-editing-operations` with `find_and_replace_text` for each section:
   - Replace summary text with tailored summary
   - Replace each experience bullet with reordered/rewritten bullets
   - Replace competency/skills text with JD-matched terms
   - Replace project descriptions with top relevant projects
c. **Reflow layout after text replacement:**
   After applying all text replacements, the text boxes auto-resize but neighboring elements stay in place. This causes uneven spacing between work experience sections. Fix this:
   1. Read the updated element positions and dimensions from the `perform-editing-operations` response
   2. For each work experience section (top to bottom), calculate where the bullets text box ends: `end_y = top + height`
   3. The next section's header should start at `end_y + consistent_gap` (use the original gap from the template, typically ~30px)
   4. Use `position_element` to move the next section's date, company name, role title, and bullets elements to maintain even spacing
   5. Repeat for all work experience sections
d. **Verify layout before commit:**
   - `get-design-thumbnail` with the transaction_id and page_index=1
   - Visually inspect the thumbnail for: text overlapping, uneven spacing, text cut off, text too small
   - If issues remain, adjust with `position_element`, `resize_element`, or `format_text`
   - Repeat until layout is clean
e. Show the user the final preview and ask for approval
f. `commit-editing-transaction` to save (ONLY after user approval)

#### Step 5 — Export and download PDF

a. `export-design` the duplicate as PDF (format: a4 or letter based on JD location)
b. **IMMEDIATELY** download the PDF using Bash:
   ```bash
   curl -sL -o "output/cv-{candidate}-{company}-canva-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf" "{download_url}"
   ```
   The export URL is a pre-signed S3 link that expires in ~2 hours. Download it right away.
c. Verify the download:
   ```bash
   file output/cv-{candidate}-{company}-canva-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf
   ```
   Must show "PDF document". If it shows XML or HTML, the URL expired — re-export and retry.
d. Report: PDF path, file size, Canva design URL (for manual tweaking)

#### Error handling

- If `import-design-from-url` fails → fall back to HTML/PDF pipeline with message
- If text elements can't be mapped → warn user, show what was found, ask for manual mapping
- If `find_and_replace_text` finds no matches → try broader substring matching
- Always provide the Canva design URL so the user can edit manually if auto-edit fails

## Cover Letter Sub-flow

After generating the CV PDF, offer to generate a cover letter:

```text
CV PDF generated: output/{path}

Want a cover letter for this role too?
- Say "yes" or "cover letter" to generate one now
- Or run `/career-ops cover {slug}` later
```

Apply `voice-dna.md` (if present) to the cover letter — full guardrail, conversational voice included (Tier 1 + Tier 2). The CV PDF itself stays Tier 1 only (formal ATS register). See `_writing.md` → Voice DNA.

If the user says yes, run the full cover letter flow from `modes/cover.md` in slug mode:
1. Load the existing `## Cover Letter Draft` from the evaluation report as a starting point
2. Run company research (Step 3 of cover.md)
3. Present keyword list for confirmation (Step 4)
4. Surface any gaps (Step 5)
5. Ask the four prompts: why / problems / approach / tone (Step 6)
6. Draft in chat, wait for approval (Steps 7-8)
7. Generate cover letter PDF via `node generate-cover-letter.mjs` (Step 9)
8. Report both PDF paths

Do not auto-generate the cover letter PDF without going through the interactive steps above.
