# Mode: email — Application Email Drafts

Generate a formal application email body that the candidate can paste into an
email client. This mode is for direct application emails, recruiter follow-up
emails with a CV attached, referral request emails, cold application emails,
and process-stuck recovery emails when the application machinery itself breaks
(a form that will not submit, a scheduling page that fails, a dead assessment
link) and email becomes the fallback channel.

It is NOT:
- `contacto`: short LinkedIn / BOSS Zhipin / chat-style outreach.
- `cover`: a full cover letter PDF.
- `apply`: live application form filling.

**Never submit. Never send email. Never click send.** Draft only. The candidate
must review and send manually.

---

## Invocation

Supported inputs:

1. `/career-ops email {report-number-or-slug}`
   - Load the matching `reports/{NNN}-*.md`.
   - Use the report header, score, archetype, PDF status, and evaluation content.
   - If `data/pdf-index.tsv` contains a row for that report, use that same row's
     HTML companion to align the fit points with the tailored CV and mention its
     PDF as the attachment candidate. If no usable tailored HTML is indexed,
     select fit points from `cv.md`. If no PDF is indexed, say that the CV
     should be generated first via `/career-ops pdf {slug}` or attached
     manually.

2. `/career-ops email {pasted JD}`
   - Use the pasted JD directly.
   - Do not create a report, tracker row, PDF, or cover letter.
   - Ask for company name if the JD lacks it and the email would otherwise read
     generic.

3. `/career-ops email`
   - If there is a most recent evaluated tracker row, offer to draft from that
     row.
   - If no usable context exists, ask for a report number, slug, or JD.

4. `/career-ops email stuck {report-number-or-slug}`
   - Load the matching `reports/{NNN}-*.md` for company and role context.
   - Draft a process-stuck recovery email (see the dedicated section below).
   - Also trigger this variant conversationally when the user describes a
     broken application step, e.g. "the ATS scheduling page is broken", "I
     can't submit the form", "the assessment link is dead", "the login loop
     won't let me back in". Confirm the variant before drafting if ambiguous.

5. `/career-ops email noshow {report-number-or-slug}`
   - Load the matching `reports/{NNN}-*.md` for company and role context.
   - Draft a confirmed-time no-show follow-up (see the dedicated section
     below).
   - Also trigger this variant conversationally when the user describes a
     missed call after a two-way scheduling confirmation, e.g. "my call with
     {interviewer} at {time} didn't happen", "we confirmed 2pm and nobody
     called", "the recruiter never dialed in". Confirm the variant before
     drafting if ambiguous — this is distinct from the cadence-driven
     follow-ups in `modes/followup.md` (see the scope note below).

---

## Step 1 — Load Context

Read:
- `config/profile.yml`
- `cv.md`
- `article-digest.md` if it exists
- `modes/_writing.md` — shared writing guidance (Voice DNA guardrail, Writing Style calibration, Professional Writing rules). An application email is candidate-facing prose, the same category that module governs (#2006)
- `modes/_profile.md` if it exists
- `modes/_custom.md` if it exists
- `voice-dna.md` if it exists, for writing style only
- The selected report if invoked by report number or slug
- `data/pdf-index.tsv` if present, to find generated PDF attachments

Use `modes/_custom.md` only for procedural output preferences such as whether to
include a contact block, whether to show an attachment checklist, or how concise
the email should be. It must never introduce contact details, work experience,
or other factual claims.

Use `voice-dna.md` only as a writing guardrail. It must never introduce factual
claims. Precedence for voice is unchanged: `modes/_profile.md` wins over
`voice-dna.md`, which wins over the generic defaults in `_writing.md`. Loading
the module adds a standard where this mode had none; it never overrides the
user's own rules.

`_writing.md` governs wording only. This mode's output contract — variants,
attachment checklist, subject/body structure, the draft-only rule — is set here
and is not affected by it.

### Tailored CV alignment source

For an invocation resolved to a report, normalize the report number when
matching `data/pdf-index.tsv` (`008` and `8` are the same report). Ignore blank
and comment rows. The manifest writer keeps one current row per report; if a
hand-edited manifest contains duplicates, use the last matching row.

Resolve the row's workspace-relative `pdf` and `html` columns against the
workspace root (the directory that contains `data/`), matching the base used by
the manifest writer. Use the HTML companion, never the PDF, as the readable
representation of the attached CV. It is usable only when the resolved HTML
path exists and is a file. Do not guess a similarly named file or silently use
an artifact belonging to the same company but a different report.

The tailored HTML is an **alignment guide, not a new source of truth**. It may
control which supported bullets are selected and how they are ordered or
framed, but every fact in the email must still be verified against the primary
source-of-truth files above. If the row is absent, malformed, or its HTML file
is unavailable, fall back explicitly to `cv.md` for fit-point selection. The
PDF path may still be shown in the attachment checklist when that file exists,
but never claim the body was aligned to it without a readable HTML companion.

### Profile fields

Use these optional fields when present:
- `candidate.full_name`
- `candidate.chinese_name`
- `candidate.email`
- `candidate.phone`
- `candidate.wechat`
- `candidate.location`
- `candidate.linkedin`
- `candidate.github`
- `candidate.portfolio_url`
- `application_email.default_sender_note`
- `application_email.include_contact_block`
- `application_email.include_attachment_checklist`
- `application_email.signature_name`
- `contact_preferences.preferred_channel`
- `contact_preferences.note`

If `candidate.wechat` is absent, omit WeChat. Do not invent one.

---

## Step 2 — Classify Email Type

Choose one of five variants from user wording or context:

| Variant | When | Tone |
|---|---|---|
| `hr_application` | Default. Sending CV to HR/recruiter for a posted role. | Formal, concise, screening-friendly |
| `referral_request` | User asks for referral, internal contact, friend, alumni, or former colleague. | Warm, low-pressure, easy to forward |
| `cold_application` | No posted role, speculative reach-out, "cold email". | Direct, value-first, no desperation |
| `process_stuck` | The ATS or application flow broke mid-process and email is the fallback channel. | Factual, forwardable, one precise ask |
| `confirmed_time_noshow` | A recruiter or interviewer confirmed a specific call time in a two-way exchange and did not call. | Professional, not annoyed; time-anchored, not apologetic |

If unclear, default to `hr_application`.

**Precedence:** any process-failure signal (a broken step, an error message, a
dead link, failed scheduling) selects `process_stuck` over the other variants.
A missed call after an explicit two-way time confirmation selects
`confirmed_time_noshow` instead — it is not a process failure (nothing broke;
someone simply did not call), so do not route it through `process_stuck`. If
a failure or a missed-call signal is hinted at but the intent is ambiguous,
ask for confirmation — do not fall through to `hr_application`. The
`hr_application` default applies only when there is no failure or no-show
indication at all.

For `process_stuck` and `confirmed_time_noshow`, skip Step 3 (fit points) and
Step 4 (attachment checklist) — the reader already has the application; these
emails exist to unblock a process or reopen a scheduling gap, not to sell —
and follow the dedicated sections below instead of the Step 5 structures.

---

## Step 3 — Extract Fit Points

From the report/JD and source-of-truth files, select 2-3 fit points. When the
Tailored CV alignment source resolved a usable HTML companion, prefer the
proof points and emphasis present in that artifact so the body describes the
CV being attached. Otherwise, use `cv.md` as the selection source and say that
HTML alignment was unavailable and `cv.md` was used before presenting the
draft. A missing HTML alignment source does not by itself mean the tailored PDF
is missing.

- One role-to-profile match: stack, domain, workflow, product type, or delivery
  style.
- One proof point: project, metric, open-source contribution, or shipped system.
- One differentiator: business ownership, domain knowledge, communication,
  open-source ecosystem, or production handover.

Use only facts from source-of-truth files. Reformulate keywords from the JD;
never fabricate.

If a report has a score:
- `>= 4.5`: confident, priority application.
- `4.0-4.4`: good match, worth applying.
- `< 4.0`: restrained; do not oversell. If below 4.0, warn the user before
  drafting that career-ops normally recommends against applying.

---

## Step 4 — Attachment Checklist

Before the draft, output:

```text
Attachments to include:
- CV: {pdf path or "attach your tailored CV"}
- Cover letter: {path if known, otherwise "optional / not generated"}
```

Rules:
- If `application_email.include_attachment_checklist` is `false`, omit this
  checklist.
- For a report-based invocation, keep the PDF candidate from the selected
  manifest row. When that row has a usable HTML companion, let it guide Step 3.
  When it does not, use `cv.md` for Step 3 as described above, but still show
  that row's PDF when the resolved PDF path exists. Do not select the prose
  source and attachment from different rows.
- Mention only files that exist or are indexed. Do not claim a cover letter
  exists unless it does.
- Do not attach files or send anything.

---

## Step 5 — Draft Structure

Always output:

```text
Subject: {subject}

{email body}
```

### HR application structure

1. Greeting
2. Role intent and attachment sentence
3. 2-3 fit points in one short paragraph or compact bullets
4. Why this role is relevant, using JD language
5. Contact block and signature

### Referral request structure

1. Greeting
2. One-line context: role and company
3. 2 concise proof points that are easy to forward
4. Low-pressure ask: "If this looks aligned, would you be comfortable referring
   me or pointing me to the right person?"
5. Contact block and signature

### Cold application structure

1. Greeting
2. Value proposition first, not "I am looking for a job"
3. 2 proof points tied to the company/domain
4. Specific ask: short call, right contact, or permission to send CV
5. Contact block and signature

---

## Process-Stuck Recovery Email (`process_stuck`)

The ATS is the normal channel; this email exists because the channel broke.
The reader is often the same recruiter who will later evaluate the candidate,
so the draft must read as a competent incident report, not a complaint.

### Intake

Before drafting, ask for whatever is missing:

1. **Which step broke:** form submit, interview/prescreen scheduling,
   assessment link, account login, or other.
2. **What the failure looks like:** error text verbatim if any, or "no error,
   the page just reloads / spins / shows no slots".
3. **What was already retried:** other browser, other device, other time
   slots, cleared session, waited and retried.
4. **Deadline pressure:** assessment window, scheduling cutoff, posting close
   date.
5. **Which contact addresses are visible** to the candidate: prior email
   threads, ATS notification sender, addresses on the posting or careers page.

### Draft structure

1. Greeting
2. One-line identification: role, application/req ID if known, candidate name
3. Reproducible, timestamped failure description a recruiter can forward to
   their ATS admin verbatim: step, exact behavior, timestamp + timezone, what
   was already retried
4. One precise ask — exactly one: schedule manually, confirm receipt, extend
   the assessment window, or resend a working link
5. One-line reaffirmation of interest in the role
6. Signature

Keep it short: 100-180 words. No blame, no apology spiral, no speculation
about what is wrong on their side, no more detail than the admin needs.

### Evidence checklist

Include in the failure description:

- Timestamp + timezone of the attempt(s)
- The step and the exact failure behavior (error text verbatim if any)
- What was already retried
- "Screenshot available on request" — mention it, never attach unprompted

### Contact triage — picking the least-wrong address

Broken ATS flows rarely expose a human contact. Rank the visible options:

1. **A recruiter or coordinator from any prior email thread** for this
   application. Best option by far: existing context, a human, an incentive
   to fix it.
2. **The reply-to of ATS notification emails** (confirmation, invite,
   assessment emails) — only if it is a human or team mailbox. Skip anything
   clearly unmonitored (`no-reply@`, `notifications@`, `donotreply@`).
3. **A general recruiting mailbox** on the posting or careers page:
   `careers@`, `recruiting@`, `talent@`, `jobs@`, `hr@`.
4. **LinkedIn message to the recruiter or hiring manager** as last resort —
   hand off to `contacto` mode for the short-form version of the same
   content.

**Never send a process-support request to a special-purpose mailbox.** These
exist for a protected or unrelated purpose, and misusing them at best gets
the email silently dropped and at worst reads as a candidate who does not
read instructions:

- Accessibility / accommodations mailboxes
- Benefits mailboxes
- Ethics / whistleblower / compliance hotlines
- Alumni mailboxes
- Press / media mailboxes

If the only visible address is a special-purpose mailbox, say so explicitly,
do not draft for that address, and recommend the LinkedIn route (option 4)
instead.

### Guardrails

All standing email-mode guardrails apply unchanged: draft only, never send,
never click, never submit. Additionally, the stuck-email draft must:

- Never threaten or escalate, and never use legal or complaint language.
- Never speculate about the cause of the failure or criticize the company's
  tooling — describe only what the candidate observed. Factual and
  forwardable, nothing else.
- Never fabricate error messages, timestamps, or retry steps. If the user
  cannot recall a detail, omit it.

### Example (generic)

All values below are placeholders — fill them only with details the user
actually provides. Never invent error text, timestamps, or retry steps.

```text
Subject: Application to {Role} ({REQ-ID}) — {broken step} issue

Hi {Company} Recruiting team,

I'm partway through the application process for {Role} ({REQ-ID}) and hit a
technical issue I can't get past: {broken step} fails on every attempt.
{Exact observed behavior — quote error text verbatim only if one exists;
otherwise describe what happens: the page reloads, keeps spinning, shows no
slots} (tried {date + time + timezone}, {what was retried}). A screenshot is
available if useful.

Could someone schedule the interview manually? Happy to take any slot that
works for the team.

I remain very interested in the role and don't want a technical glitch to
stall the process.

Best regards,
{Candidate Name}
{email}
```

## Confirmed-Time No-Show Follow-up (`confirmed_time_noshow`)

**Scope note:** this variant is unrelated to the elapsed-time cadence in
`modes/followup.md` / `followup-cadence.mjs` (applied: 7 days, responded: 3
days, interview: 1 day). Those track "it's been N days since the status
changed." This variant is same-day and commitment-specific: a recruiter or
interviewer explicitly confirmed a call time in a two-way exchange (email,
ATS scheduler, text) and the call did not happen. There is no day-elapsed
scoring here and no `followup-cadence.mjs` output to read — the trigger is
the user telling you the confirmed time passed with no call.

### Intake

Required, always ask for whatever is missing (do not invent any of these):

1. **The confirmed date/time**, as agreed in the exchange (include timezone
   if known).
   Before drafting, verify that this time has passed and is today in the
   relevant timezone; otherwise clarify the scenario or use another variant.
2. **The interviewer or recruiter's name**, exactly as given by the user —
   do not scrape or guess it from a report.
3. **Remaining same-day availability** the user wants to offer (a window,
   e.g. "before 4pm today" or "any time after 2:30").
4. Company and role, for the subject line (from the linked report if one was
   given, otherwise ask).

### Draft structure

1. Greeting, addressed to the named interviewer/recruiter by name.
2. One plain sentence stating the confirmed time and that the call did not
   happen. State it as a fact, not an accusation — no "I was very
   disappointed" or over-apologizing for pointing it out.
3. One sentence offering the remaining same-day availability the user gave.
4. One-line reaffirmation of interest — brief, not a resell of fit points
   (Step 3 is skipped for this variant).
5. Signature.

Keep it short: under 120 words. Reference the specific confirmed time
plainly once in the body (the subject line may also reference it); do not
restate it more than once in the body or pad with general "just checking in"
framing (same banned-phrase rule as `modes/followup.md`).

### Guardrails

- **Tone is professional, not annoyed.** No passive-aggressive phrasing
  ("I waited...", "I understand things come up, but..."), no guilt framing,
  no exclamation points.
- Never fabricate the confirmed time, the interviewer's name, or the
  availability window — all three are user-provided inputs, never inferred
  or scraped from a report.
- Never speculate about why the call was missed (traffic, forgot, double
  booked). State the fact and move to the ask.
- This is a single follow-up for a single missed commitment, not a
  multi-touch cadence — do not suggest a second no-show follow-up; if a
  second miss happens, treat that as its own new instance of this same
  scenario.
- All standing email-mode guardrails apply unchanged: draft only, never
  send, never click, never submit.

### Example (generic)

All values are placeholders. Fill them only with details the user actually
provides.

```text
Subject: {Role} — following up on our {time} call

Hi {Interviewer Name},

We'd confirmed a call today at {confirmed time, timezone} for the {Role}
role, and I didn't receive it. I'm available {remaining availability window}
if there's still time to connect today.

Still very interested in the role and happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
{Candidate Name}
```

---

## Language

- Match the JD/report language.
- If the JD is Chinese, use Simplified Chinese.
- If the company/recruiter language is unknown, default to the user's language.
- Keep the subject line in the same language as the body unless the user asks
  otherwise.

---

## Contact Block

Default behavior:
- Include contact block for direct application emails.
- Omit phone in short social outreach; this mode is not short social outreach.

Use:

```text
联系方式：
{if candidate.wechat}微信：{candidate.wechat}{/if}
{if candidate.phone}手机号：{candidate.phone}{/if}
{if candidate.email or application_email.default_sender_note}邮箱：{candidate.email or application_email.default_sender_note}{/if}
```

For English:

```text
Contact:
{if candidate.wechat}WeChat: {candidate.wechat}{/if}
{if candidate.phone}Phone: {candidate.phone}{/if}
{if candidate.email or application_email.default_sender_note}Email: {candidate.email or application_email.default_sender_note}{/if}
```

If `application_email.default_sender_note` is set in `config/profile.yml` to a
phrase such as "the email used to send this message", use that phrase instead of
a concrete email address.

If `application_email.include_contact_block` is `false`, use a normal signature
only.

**Contact channel preference:** If `application_email.include_contact_block` is
`true` (or absent/default), check `contact_preferences.preferred_channel` in
`config/profile.yml`. If it is absent or set to `"either"`, the contact block
stays exactly as above — no change. If it is set to `"email"` or `"phone"`, add
one short line directly under the contact block naming that preference, e.g.:

```text
Contact:
Email: jane@example.com
Phone: +1-555-0123
(Prefers email first.)
```

If `contact_preferences.note` is set, use its wording (or a close paraphrase)
for that line instead of a generic phrase. Keep it to one line, no bold, no
extra emphasis -- it should read as a practical note, not a demand.

---

## Style Rules

`_writing.md` → Professional Writing & ATS Compatibility carries the shared
cliché list and specifics-over-abstractions rule. These are the email-specific
additions.

- No corporate-speak.
- No "perfect fit", "unique opportunity", or vague praise (the shared list covers "passionate about" and its relatives).
- No exaggerated authorship claims.
- Short paragraphs. Prefer 150-250 words for HR applications.
- Keep the proof easy to scan.
- Do not include salary unless the user asks.
- Do not include private references, ID numbers, or unsupported claims.

---

## Output

Return in this order:

1. Context line:
   - `Source: report {NNN}` or `Source: pasted JD`
   - Variant
   - Language
2. Attachment checklist, unless disabled
3. Subject and email body
4. One-line note with any missing inputs or assumptions

Do not write files unless the user explicitly asks to save the draft.
