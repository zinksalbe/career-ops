// tests/scan-ats-full-outage-checkpoint.test.mjs — a sweep stopped by the
// resolver circuit breaker must LEAVE its checkpoint on disk, and leave it
// pointing at where the sweep actually stopped (#2283).
//
// The end of main() deletes the checkpoint unconditionally ("sweep completed —
// the checkpoint's job is done"), and the outage `break` falls straight into
// that exit path, so the stop deliberately designed to be resumable destroyed
// the only file `--resume` reads.
//
// Driven end-to-end in a child process rather than against an exported helper:
// the bug is not in any single function but in the interaction between the
// breaker, the checkpoint writer, and the exit path, and only a whole run
// exercises all three. The child runs against a sandbox data root — pointed at
// by CAREER_OPS_ROOT, since scan-ats-full.mjs's paths follow the data root
// rather than the cwd (#3510) — with a stubbed `dns.lookup`, so no network is
// involved and the resolver's behaviour is exact:
//
//   EAI_AGAIN  — a resolver-level failure; trips the breaker  → checkpoint kept
//   ENOTFOUND  — NXDOMAIN, an ordinary dead board; no outage  → checkpoint deleted
//
// The ENOTFOUND arm is load-bearing. Without it a fix that simply never
// deleted the checkpoint would pass, and every clean sweep would leave a stale
// file behind that makes the next run warn and demand --resume.
