/**
 * Build a throwaway git repository for the two updater suites that drive git
 * through the `gitIn` seam (`updater-add-paths`, `updater-is-tracked`). Only
 * the first asserts on ignore RESOLUTION; the second writes its own .gitignore
 * and then asks about index membership, which is a different question.
 *
 * The pins below are the reason this is shared rather than copied, but they are
 * not all load-bearing for both callers, and this docstring should not imply
 * otherwise. Mutation-tested by dropping each pin under a GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL it
 * exists to neutralise:
 *
 *   - `commit.gpgsign=false` and `core.hooksPath` → an empty dir. Either one
 *     inherited from the environment breaks every commit the fixtures make.
 *     Dropping either reddens BOTH suites.
 *   - `core.excludesFile` → an empty file. A global ignore rule silently alters
 *     what is measured (the failure mode reported in #2269). Dropping it reddens
 *     updater-add-paths only: updater-is-tracked writes its own .gitignore and
 *     then reads index membership, which a global rule does not move. Kept for
 *     both as a defensive pin, proven by one.
 *
 * Point `core.excludesFile` at an empty file rather than /dev/null: git on
 * Windows maps that to `nul` and dies with "fatal: cannot use nul as an
 * exclude file".
 *
 * Kept as one body so a pin cannot be dropped from one caller while the other
 * keeps it — which is the drift CodeRabbit flagged on #2531, where two copies
 * meant a pin added to one left the other silently unprotected. Note that is a
 * weaker guarantee than "deleting a pin fails both suites", which the table
 * above shows is only true for two of the three.
 *
 * The two other `makeRepo` fixtures under tests/ are deliberately NOT folded in
 * here: `updater-local-system-edits` pins line endings instead of excludes and
 * seeds a base commit plus an `upstream` branch, and `updater-rollback-behavior`
 * pins nothing. They are different fixtures that share a name, not copies of
 * this one.
 *
 * `gitIn` is injected rather than imported so this module keeps depending on
 * nothing but Node builtins — 57 of the 62 suites import it, and none of them
 * should pull in update-system.mjs as a side effect of asking for `pass`/`fail`.
 *
 * @param {(dir: string, ...args: string[]) => any} gitIn - Updater's git runner.
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {string} [options.prefix='co-updater-'] - mkdtemp prefix, so a leftover
 *   temp dir names the suite that made it.
 * @param {boolean} [options.includeRoot=false] - Add `root` to the returned ctx.
 *   `addPaths` resolves paths against it to decide what is a directory; without
 *   it the guard would lstat the real career-ops checkout instead of the
 *   fixture. `isTracked` never reads it.
 * @returns {{dir: string, g: Function, ctx: {git: Function, root?: string}}}

 * that way overrides even the one a fixture sets for itself, and the isolation

 *
 * COUNT is set to 0 rather than deleting the variables: it is a single
 * authoritative value, and git reads KEY_n / VALUE_n only up to COUNT, so any
 * stragglers are inert without having to enumerate them.
 *
 * `base` exists so a regression case can hand in a parent environment

 * dropped here, which is how the gap got in.

/**
 * Can a directory write-deny actually stop THIS process from creating a file?
 *
 * Two suites arrange a write failure by making the tracker's directory
 * unwritable and asserting the structured error that follows. An elevated
 * Windows shell is not bound by that ACE: the temp-file write lands, the CLI
 * exits 0, and the assertion reports `code=0 json=undefined`, which reads like
 * the CLI is broken rather than like a setup step that could not be arranged
 * (#3423). That is the same "permissions do not apply to me" case those suites
 * already skip for root on POSIX, so it takes the same loud skip.
 *
 * Measured, never inferred: this performs the very operation those tests depend
 * on - apply the deny, then create a file with the same fs API - instead of
 * asking a proxy whether the shell is elevated. A proxy is the wrong tool here.
 * A restricted token still lists the Administrators SID in `whoami /groups`
 * (present for deny only), and inside one elevated token PowerShell's
 * Set-Content is refused while Node's writeFileSync succeeds, so "is elevated"
 * and "can still write" are genuinely different questions.
 *
 * Fails toward RUNNING the assertion: if the probe cannot be arranged at all
 * (no icacls, a non-zero exit, anything thrown) it answers true so the caller
 * still executes its check. A skip on an inconclusive probe would quietly turn
 * "the failure could not be arranged" into "the failure handling is fine",
 * which is the blind spot those assertions exist to catch.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in each suite because the two copies of this setup
 * have already drifted once: `tests/mark-pdf-ready.test.mjs` says it mirrors
 * `set-status-tests.mjs`, and it mirrored this bug along with the arrangement.
 *
 * @returns {boolean} true when the deny binds, or when it could not be evaluated.
