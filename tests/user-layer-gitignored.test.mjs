// AGENTS.md declares a User Layer: the files a candidate fills with their own
// personal data. Every one of those paths must be git-ignored, or a contributor
// working in a fork can stage their own CV, proof points or tracker into a public
// repository with a reflexive `git add .`.
//
// article-digest.md drifted off .gitignore while remaining on the AGENTS.md list.
// This test compares the two lists directly so they cannot diverge again.

 * checkout where they are ignored (#3165): a false negative on the one
 * assertion in the file whose whole point is to be trustworthy.

// The tracker's DERIVED SQLite index (tracker.mjs, #918), which carries the
// same content as the markdown it indexes — company, role, score, status,
// notes.
//
// On the standard layout it lands in data/ and the rules above already cover
// it. But resolveTrackerPath() falls back to `<root>/applications.md` when
// data/applications.md is absent, and the index follows the markdown, so on
// the legacy layout it sits in the repo root instead. That is also every fresh
// clone: `node test-all.mjs` leaves one there, 36KB, ready for `git add .`.
//
// The nested probes are the ones that decide the SHAPE of the rule. A
// root-anchored `/*.db` covers the repo root and nothing else, and would still
// pass every root probe below — but getCareerOpsRoot() resolves a RELATIVE
// CAREER_OPS_ROOT (or .career-ops-data marker) against the codebase directory,
// so a data root configured as `career-data` puts the tracker, and its index,
// in a subdirectory of the checkout. `data/applications.db` cannot settle this
// on its own: it is already covered by the blanket `data/*` rule at the top of
// the file, so it passes either way.
//
// Built as a cross-product rather than hand-listed. tracker.mjs derives every
// one of these from a single path — DB_PATH is resolveTrackerPath() with .md
// swapped for .db, and SQLite appends the sidecar suffixes to that — so any
// directory that can hold the index can hold all three names. Enumerating them
// by hand is how the -shm sidecar ended up covered in the repo root and missed
// one directory down.
// The tracker and its follow-ups file in the LEGACY ROOT LAYOUT — the third
// entry in resolveTrackerPath()'s own documented fallback chain
// (CAREER_OPS_TRACKER > <root>/data/applications.md > <root>/applications.md),
// and a supported install shape rather than a mistake.
//
// data/ is covered by the blanket rule at the top of .gitignore; the root
// spelling was covered by nothing, so the file holding the user's entire job
// search — company, role, score, status, notes — sat untracked and unignored,
// one `git add .` from a commit. The derived .db index beside it was ignored
// first, on the argument that it carries the same PII as the tracker.
