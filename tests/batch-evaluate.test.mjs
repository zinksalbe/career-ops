// later sections, and that variable stays pointed at this temp directory for a
// window whose length depends on how fast the fixture runs — which is exactly
// how the intermittent macOS-only page-budget failure in #3162 happened: a
// valid repo path got compared against this fixture's root. The finally below
// does restore it, but only once the work finishes. Awaiting here means the
// import does not resolve until the environment is clean again.
