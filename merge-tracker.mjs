 * merge-tracker.mjs — Merge batch tracker additions into applications.md
 *
 * Handles multiple TSV formats:
 * - Headed (preferred): a first row of column LABELS, then one data row. Column
 *   order is then irrelevant — fields resolve by name through the same alias
 *   table as the tracker itself (#3517).
 * - 9-col headerless: num\tdate\tcompany\trole\tstatus\tscore\tpdf\treport\tnotes
 * - 8-col headerless: num\tdate\tcompany\trole\tstatus\tscore\tpdf\treport (no notes)
 * - Pipe-delimited (markdown table row): | col | col | ... |
 *
 * Dedup: company normalized + role fuzzy match + report number match
 * If duplicate with higher score → update in-place, update report link
 * Validates status against states.yml (rejects non-canonical, logs warning)
 *
 * Run: node merge-tracker.mjs [--dry-run] [--verify]
