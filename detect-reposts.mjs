/**
 * detect-reposts.mjs — Repost Detector for career-ops
 *
 * Reads data/scan-history.tsv, groups rows by company, groups role titles by
 * title identity (see titleIdentityKey), and flags any company+role that
 * appears 2+ times with different URLs, on 2+ distinct scan dates, within a
 * 90-day window. Such clusters are almost certainly the same opening being
 * re-listed by the employer — useful for tracking stale pipelines and
 * ghost postings.
 *
 * Only rows with status `added` are considered. Rows with a non-`added`
 * status (`skipped_expired`, `skipped_invalid_url`, `skipped_blocked_host`)
 * describe dead postings, not reposts, and are skipped.
 *
 * TWO CONSTRAINTS SEPARATE A REPOST FROM A SIBLING REQUISITION. Both were
 * added after the detector reported `reposts-detected` for three companies
 * that had never reposted anything:
 *
 *   1. MINIMUM SPAN. `first_seen` is when the SCANNER first saw a URL, not
 *      when the employer posted it. A whole company is swept at once, so two
 *      URLs sharing a first_seen date were listed CONCURRENTLY — that is the
 *      signature of parallel openings, and the exact opposite of a repost,
 *      which requires the role to reappear later. A cluster whose members all
 *      come from one sweep therefore spans 0 days and cannot be evidence of
 *      reposting at all. See MIN_REPOST_SPAN_DAYS / --min-span.
 *
 *   2. TITLE IDENTITY, not title similarity. This used to group titles with
 *      roleFuzzyMatch, which merges any two titles clearing a 0.6 Jaccard
 *      ratio. Per-region and per-segment variants of one job land exactly on
 *      that boundary — "Commercial Solutions Engineer - Munich" vs "- Berlin"
 *      share 3 of 5 tokens — so a company that fans one opening out across
 *      cities read as a company reposting. Those are distinct requisitions
 *      hiring distinct headcount, and merging them is a fabricated signal.
 *      Membership now requires the same SET of title words, which still
 *      tolerates word-order and punctuation churn between two listings of one
 *      role but never merges titles that differ by a city, country, language,
 *      segment or seniority word.
 *
 * ONE CASE THE TITLE RULE CANNOT SETTLE: a multi-employer aggregator. Its board
 * carries many different employers' postings under its own name, so identical
 * titles there are genuinely different jobs and every rule above rests on an
 * assumption that does not hold — same company + same title = same opening.
 * Mark such an entry `aggregator: true` in portals.yml and this skips it
 * entirely (see loadAggregatorCompanies, #2703). It has to be config: measured
 * on a real history, an aggregator's clusters are indistinguishable by shape
 * from legitimate ones.
 *

// shape (both median 2 sightings over 2 dates, 1 row per date); the best
// threshold available removed under half the aggregator clusters and needed a
// magic number to do it. See #2703.
//
// portals.yml is a USER-LAYER file and may be absent (a fresh install, a
// sandboxed test, CI). Absent, unreadable or malformed all degrade to "no
// aggregators", which is exactly the behaviour before this existed — the

// that card would be titled with the normalized key — "joinupch" rather than

// alternatives on either side of it:
//
//   - Raw string equality is too tight. One opening re-listed months later
//     routinely comes back with the words reordered or repunctuated
//     ("Forward Deployed Engineer - Sweden" -> "Forward Deployed Engineer,
//     Sweden"), and a detector that misses those misses real reposts.
//
//   - roleFuzzyMatch (what this used to use) is too loose. It merges titles
//     that merely overlap enough, which is precisely how a family of sibling
//     requisitions — same job, one per city/country/language/segment/level —
//     collapses into a phantom repost cluster.
//
// Set equality sits exactly between them: every word must be accounted for on
// both sides, so any city, country, language or seniority word present in one
// title and absent from the other splits the two apart, while their ORDER and
// punctuation are free to drift.
//
// No length or stopword filtering, deliberately. roleTokens drops words of 3
// characters or fewer, which would erase the only thing distinguishing "…
// Engineer - UK" from "… Engineer - US" and merge two countries' openings.
//
// Word splitting is script-preserving: it keeps any Unicode letter or number
// and treats everything else as a separator, following the same reasoning as
// #2429 for company names. Restricting to [a-z0-9] would fold every Japanese
// or Cyrillic title to the empty string, and every such title at one company
// would then share a key. A CJK title has no spaces to split on, so it stays a
// single word and matches only its exact self — no over-clustering either way.

// raw text, the same guard companyKey uses.
