/**
 * mjs-files.mjs — the one definition of "every .mjs file in this repository".
 *
 * Two things syntax-check this repo: `scripts/check-syntax.mjs` (run as
 * `npm run lint`) and section 1 of `test-all.mjs`. They used to disagree about
 * what "every file" meant, and only one of them said so.
 *
 * `test-all.mjs` read the repository root with a NON-recursive `readdirSync`,
 * so its gate covered 121 of the ~575 `.mjs` files here — and it printed one
 * `{file} syntax OK` line per file, so a reader watching 121 green lines had no
 * way to tell that the directory holding 263 of them was never opened. Worse,
 * the gate NARROWED every time a file moved out of the root and never
 * mentioned it: #3306 moved eleven suites into `tests/` and #3388 moved nine,
 * and each one silently left the gate. The shortfall was eventually noticed
 * only as a two-check arithmetic discrepancy in an unrelated PR (#3411), which
 * is not a way to find out (#3419).
 *
 * Sharing the walker is the fix rather than copying the recursion into
 * `test-all.mjs`: two independently maintained definitions of the same set is
 * exactly the drift that caused this, and a second copy would be free to
 * re-diverge the next time one of them learned about a directory.

/**
 * Is `dir` a checkout of its own, rather than a subdirectory of this one?
 *
 * `SKIP_DIRS` drops a directory *named* `.git`, which is the whole of git's
 * storage in a normal clone — and none of it in a linked worktree, which marks
 * itself with a `.git` FILE pointing at the parent's gitdir. So the one
 * exclusion meant to keep git out of the walk slid straight past a worktree and
 * the walkers descended into a complete second copy of the repository, at
 * whatever commit that worktree happened to sit on: 1097 files reported in a
 * 576-file checkout (#3499).
 *
 * The consequences differed per consumer, which is what made it hard to see.
 * The syntax gates silently checked ~2x the files and reported a count that
 * depended on whether the developer had a worktree open;
 * `tests/local-today-gates.test.mjs` failed outright, naming *correct* source
 * files as violations because the stale copies predated the convention;
 * `tests/main-guard-convention.test.mjs` passed, because the stale copy
 * happened to satisfy that particular convention. A contributor got a red suite
 * for a commit they did not write, or a green one that checked the wrong tree —
 * the exact "gate covering a file set nobody chose" failure this module exists
 * to remove (#3306, #3388, #3411, #3419).
 *
 * Detecting the marker rather than the name is both narrower and broader than
 * blanket-ignoring `.claude/worktrees/` (Claude Code's default location, which
 * is how this was found): it holds for a worktree placed anywhere, and it costs
 * nothing for a checkout that has none.
 *
 * Any `.git` entry counts, of either type. A `.git` file is a linked worktree
 * or a submodule; a `.git` directory below the root is a nested independent
 * clone. All three are somebody else's source tree that happens to sit inside
 * this one, and none of them is a file this repository's gates should be
 * grading.
 *
 * NOT applied to the walk root. The root's own `.git` is what makes it the
 * repository, and this predicate is deliberately blind to how the root is
 * stored — running the gate from inside a linked worktree (`.git` is a file
 * there too) must check that worktree's source, not skip all of it and report a
 * passing scan of nothing.
