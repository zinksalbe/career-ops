/**
 * Shared CV payload key contract for build-cv-html.mjs and build-cv-latex.mjs.
 *
 * Both builders render each list section from a fixed set of keys. A payload
 * that names them differently produced an empty block while the JSON report
 * still said {"valid": true} — an education section written as
 * {institution, degree, dates} against the HTML builder rendered nothing at
 * all, and CVs went out with no education section (#3523).
 *
 * The two formats do NOT share one schema, which is how the confusion starts:
 * the LaTeX template's education entry really is {institution, degree, location,
 * dates, coursework}, while the HTML template's is {title, org, location, year,
 * description}. Keeping both tables side by side here makes the divergence
 * explicit and lets each builder reject the other's vocabulary by name instead
 * of silently dropping it.
