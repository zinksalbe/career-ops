// title-keywords.mjs — one definition of how a `title_filter` keyword matches a
// job title, imported by every path that filters titles.
//
// It lives in its own module because there are two such paths and they must not
// drift: scan.mjs (the main pipeline) and openrouter-runner.mjs (the no-Claude
// path, which deliberately does not import scan.mjs because scan.mjs creates
// data/ at import time). Same reason user-agent.mjs and profile-language.mjs
// are separate modules rather than exports of a bigger one.
//
// The repo has already paid for a mirror once: tests/profile-keywords-parity
// exists because web/ carries a copy of the keyword logic and the copy was
// wrong. A second copy of THIS logic would repeat that, so there is one.

// Opt-in whole-word matching for a keyword too long to get it automatically.
// Chosen over widening the 2-3 char rule to every single-word keyword, because
// the right-hand boundary is exactly what a NEGATIVE usually wants to keep:
// "crypto" is meant to catch "Cryptocurrency" and "fellows" to catch
// "Fellowship", and anchoring the whole list would silently stop both. So the
// list says which entries want it, one entry at a time.
//
// The prefix cannot collide with a real keyword: a job title never contains a
// colon-suffixed "word", and an entry is one keyword, not a sentence.
export const WORD_PREFIX = 'word:';

// `stem:` is the other half of the same question, and it exists because the two
// halves are NOT the same setting seen from two sides.
//
// `word:agent` says "agent, and nothing longer" — it rejects Agentforce.
// `stem:agent` says "a word that STARTS with agent" — it keeps Agentforce and
// Agentic, and drops Reagents, where the keyword lands mid-word.
// A bare `agent`, today's default, keeps all three.
//
// So a plain substring is not "the loose option"; it is two loosenesses at once,
// and only one of them is usually wanted. `stem:` lets an entry ask for the one
// it means. Under today's substring default that is already a narrowing rather
// than a no-op: it is what separates Agentforce from Reagents (#3103).

// reintroduces, inside this module, exactly the drift the module exists to
// prevent: the acronym branch used ASCII \b while the `word:` branch had been
// made Unicode-aware, so `vp` still matched inside an accented word.
//
// String.raw, not a plain template literal: `\p` is not a recognised string
// escape, so an ordinary template drops the backslash and the class degenerates
// to the literal characters p, {, L, } — no error, and the anchor is simply off.

// when `kw` carries a recognised prefix, or null when it is an ordinary keyword
// the caller compiles its own way (the title filter auto-anchors short
// acronyms and falls back to substring; the content filter goes straight to
// substring — see #3103, #3274).
//
// Explicit alphanumeric lookarounds rather than \b, because \b's meaning
// depends on the characters at the keyword's own edges: for `word:c++` a
// trailing \b would sit after "+" and assert the opposite of the intent.
// WORD_CHAR rather than [a-z0-9_]: an ASCII-only lookaround treats every
// accented letter as a separator, so `word:intern` matched inside "preintern"
// spelled with an accent and vetoed exactly the international titles this
// prefix exists to protect. \p{M} covers combining marks, so a decomposed "é"
// does not split a word either.
