# Source Indexing Log

Every source that goes through the [Source Indexing Policy](../CONTRIBUTING.md#source-indexing-policy) gets an entry here: what was proposed, who proposed it, which rules were checked, and how they were verified. The point is that a stranger can reconstruct any decision from the outside without asking anyone.

Two things this log deliberately is not: a ranking, and a promise. Rule 4 says it plainly — indexing is not endorsement, and distribution is not owed.

**How to read an entry.** "Verified" means someone ran a command and reported the output, not that a claim was accepted. Where a check could only be done against a live endpoint, the entry says what was sampled and when, because live checks expire: a source that passed in August can drift in November, and re-verification is normal rather than an accusation.

**Adding an entry.** A source is logged when its provider merges. Anyone can open a [source proposal](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/issues/new?template=source-proposal.yml); the discussion happens in the issue and the PR, and this file is the durable summary with links back to both.

| **Provider** | `providers/remotli.mjs` |
| **PR** | [#2465](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/pull/2465) · issue [#2464](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/issues/2464) |
| **Merged** | 2026-08-07 |
| **Status** | Listed |

First source reviewed under the written policy. The operator proposing their own board is exactly the case the rules exist for: the disclosure came first, and the rules decided rather than a conversation.

**Rule 1 (real listings, identifiable employer, free for candidates).** Verified: listings resolve to named employers, no candidate-side paywall or registration on the source.

**Rule 2 (canonical URL is the employer's).** The provider prefers each listing's upstream `applyUrl` and falls back to the board page only when that is missing or not `https:`. Verified by sampling 121 rows across pages 1, 9 and 19 of the live feed: zero rows without an employer URL, zero non-https, zero pointing back at remotli.ch. The host distribution was ordinary employer infrastructure (Greenhouse, Workday, Ashby, Lever, Recruitee, company career pages), with no tracking hop in between.

**Rule 3 (complete inventory, no paid placement).** The operator disclosed a coverage gap in his own proposal: without the `remote=all` parameter the feed serves 392 of 921 roles, 42.6% of the board. The merged provider walks all 19 pages. No promoted or sponsored field exists in the payload.

**Rule 4 (operator declared).** The [supported boards table](SUPPORTED_JOB_BOARDS.md) row carries `operator: eliador90` with a link to this policy.

**Rule 5 (aggregation stays in core).** The provider reads its own source only. Ranking and cross-source work stay where they always were.

**Also checked, outside the policy:** zero-auth (a plain `curl` with no key, cookie or session returns the feed), and two HIGH CodeQL alerts raised in review were resolved before merge.

## a16z speedrun talent network

|---|---|
| **Proposed by** | @justma16ze (community contributor, not affiliated with the source) |
| **Provider** | `providers/a16z-speedrun.mjs` |
| **PR** | [#2231](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/pull/2231) |
| **Merged** | 2026-07-29 |
| **Status** | Listed |

Merged before the policy was written, and logged here because it is the case that prompted writing it: a large, well-connected talent network is exactly where "does indexing imply endorsement?" stops being theoretical.

**Rule 3, retroactively.** Two coverage defects were found and fixed after listing, both by contributors reading the live feed rather than the code: the page size was set to 100 while the feed serves 50, so the fetch stopped silently after one page ([#2419](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/pull/2419)), and a single transient upstream failure aborted the whole board fetch ([#2506](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/issues/2506)). Both are the failure mode rule 3 targets: partial coverage that reads as complete.

**Rule 4.** Listed with its operator declared. Rule 4's 40% ceiling exists so no single source, however large, dominates the registry.

## theirstack.com (retired from the plugin registry)

|---|---|
| **Proposed by** | @d-ulker (registration issue [#1697](https://github.com/career-ops-hq/career-ops/issues/1697)); plugin published by @uelkerd |
| **Plugin** | `career-ops-plugin-theirstack` (community plugin, `provider` hook, `THEIRSTACK_API_KEY`) |
| **Listed** | 2026-07-07, before this policy existed (2026-08-04) |
| **Retired** | 2026-09-05 |
| **Status** | Not listed. The plugin remains published in its own repository; the registry is only what the project lists. |

Re-read against the written policy after a second source of the same shape asked to be listed (JobsPipe, [#3841](https://github.com/career-ops-hq/career-ops/pull/3841)), so that the two answers match.

**Rule 1 (real listings, identifiable employer, free for candidates).** Not met as a listed source: access to the listings goes through a metered, paid API on the job seeker's side, and a free tier does not change that. Manifesto right 4 (*"You never pay"*) applied to sources is the whole of this rule; it has no free-tier exception.

**Rule 5 (aggregation belongs to the project).** The value of the source is a cross-source feed ("50k+ sources"), which is the layer the policy keeps in core.

**Rules 2, 3 and 4.** Not re-verified: rule 1 decides on its own. Rule 4 is worth restating for the record: indexing is not endorsement, and retiring a listing is not a judgement on the product.
